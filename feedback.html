                <h5>In conclusion,</h5>
                <p>Happiness is not far-fetched, it comes from the simplest things in our life, 
                    although sometimes life is rushed, busy with many things that we have not yet felt. 
                    True happiness comes from within each person. Only with happiness can family members love 
                    each other. Once each person is happy, they will spread and create a community of happy 
                    people. It would be great if each of us could experience this wonderful feeling.</p>
                <p>Without looking for something too far away, money, fame, and status is just a vicious 
                    cycle. It is important that you can feel happy and enjoy your life from the simple things, 
                    embrace and welcome happiness to come. Happiness is right in front of us, just slow down 
                    a little to grow your happiness inside of you.</p>
