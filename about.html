                <h2>About My Website</h2>
                <p>Hello. My name is Trang. This website is just a corner in which I can put some 
                    my favorite of things.</p>
                <p>Like a squirrels hide its precious nuts deep in its nest, just for a few moments 
                    gnawing happily~</p>                
                <img src="images/squirrel.jpg" alt="I'm a squirrel storing my nuts!" class="center"> 
                    <!--https://c.wallhere.com/photos/fd/dc/squirrel_nuts_food-599710.jpg!d-->
                <p>There is a difference between me and the squirrel.</p>
                <p>I see that, all of us have a special emotion, which often have us experence the 
                    same feeling of the others, which... is the origin of kindness, tolerance, 
                    forgiveness, patience, mercy, love, sharing.
                <p>It is <q><strong>empathy</strong></q>.</p>
                <img src="images/empathy.png" alt="The meaning of empathy" class="center"> 
                    <!--https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5b/f4/ba/5bf4ba3728c5d90b1f99b3020438704c.png-->
                <p>Empathy makes us feel what the others feel.</p>                
                <p>In fact, when we just store somethings precious, we feel fascinating. 
                    But when we look at them, in our litter shell, it is more than satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Consider it, I seem to store a part of my happiness here.</p>
                <p><em>All I want to say is that, I hope my website, my happiness, may somehow make 
                    you happy, even a litter.</em></p>

                <p>Many research have proven that our happiness usually comes from <q>enjoyment</q> - 
                    when we do somethings, and totally enjoy them.</p>
                <p>So, what is actually that <q>something</q>?</p> 
                <p>Things that invoke our enthusiasm, our passion!</p>
                <p>Hobbies.</p>
                <p>Therefore, what can we do to enjoy them?</p>
                <p>There are many ways: visually, aurally, sensably... All depends on your style.</p>
                <p>And now, I will show you my ways to do it.</p>

                <p>2. Happiness comes when we stop complaining about the troubles we have and offer thanks

                <p>3. The happiest people don’t have the best of everything. They just make the best of

                    you are in now.</p>
